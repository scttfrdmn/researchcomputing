# ResearchComputing

**A unified platform for modern research computing**

Welcome to ResearchComputing - an integrated ecosystem of tools designed to make cloud-based research computing accessible, efficient, and cost-effective for scientists, researchers, and research organizations.

## Overview

ResearchComputing provides a comprehensive suite of cloud-native tools that work together to support the entire research computing lifecycle - from account provisioning and interactive workstations to high-performance batch computing and long-term data archiving.

## Integration Flow

The ResearchComputing ecosystem is designed with integration in mind. Here's how the tools work together:

### 1. **Account Provisioning**
Start with **petri** to provision and manage AWS accounts for research groups.

### 2. **Development & Exploration**
Use **cloudworkstation** for interactive sessions or **lens** for notebook-based development.

### 3. **Production Computing**
Scale to **atom** for HPC batch workloads, or use **orca** to burst from on-premises Kubernetes.

### 4. **Long-Term Storage**
Archive results and datasets with **cargoship** for cost-effective long-term retention.

## Design Principles

All ResearchComputing tools share common design principles:

- **Cloud-Native**: Built for the cloud, not adapted from legacy systems
- **Cost-Transparent**: Always show estimated and actual costs
- **Security First**: Private networking, encryption, least-privilege access
- **Research-Focused**: Designed for scientific workflows and use cases
- **Container-Based**: Reproducible environments via containers
- **Simple UX**: Complex infrastructure, simple user experience

## Who Uses ResearchComputing?

### Universities and Research Institutions
Provide cloud computing resources to multiple labs and research groups with centralized management and cost allocation.

### Research Labs
Enable researchers to focus on science rather than infrastructure management, with easy access to interactive and batch computing.

### Individual Researchers
Access powerful cloud resources without deep AWS knowledge, with tools designed for scientific workflows.

### HPC Centers
Extend on-premises infrastructure to the cloud for burst capacity and specialized workloads.
