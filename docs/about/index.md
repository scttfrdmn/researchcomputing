# About ResearchComputing

ResearchComputing is a unified platform for modern research computing, providing an integrated ecosystem of tools that make cloud-based scientific computing accessible, efficient, and cost-effective.

## Mission

Our mission is to make high-performance computing accessible to researchers worldwide by removing infrastructure complexity and providing tools designed specifically for computational science.

## Philosophy

### Cloud-Native First
We build for the cloud from the ground up, not adapting legacy HPC systems. This means:

- **Elastic scaling** - From 1 to 1000 cores instantly
- **Containerized workloads** - Reproducible environments
- **Serverless orchestration** - No cluster management
- **Pay-per-use** - Cost efficiency

### Research-Focused
Every design decision is made with researchers in mind:

- **Simple UX** - Scientists shouldn't need to be AWS experts
- **Cost transparency** - Know costs before running
- **Scientific workflows** - Built for real research patterns
- **Reproducibility** - Container-based for consistency

### Open Source
All ResearchComputing projects are open source (Apache 2.0):

- Transparent development
- Community contributions welcome
- Vendor lock-in prevention
- Academic collaboration

## The Team

### Scott Friedman
**Creator and Lead Developer**

[GitHub](https://github.com/scttfrdmn) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scttfrdmn)

Scott has worked with research computing organizations for over a decade, helping labs and universities adopt cloud computing for scientific workloads. ResearchComputing emerged from patterns observed across dozens of research groups.

## Technology

ResearchComputing leverages modern cloud-native technologies:

- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CDK, Terraform
- **Containers**: Docker, Amazon ECR
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes, AWS Batch, ECS
- **Languages**: Go, Python, TypeScript
- **Documentation**: MkDocs Material

See the [Ecosystem Overview](/ecosystem/overview) for detailed architecture.
